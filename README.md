-- This is my first Odin Project. The assignment is to recreate the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS styles. --!
I had a lot of trouble initially with aligning elements, such as getting the Google logo, search bar, and buttons to all align in the center of the page, as well as floating the top nav bar and footer elements correctly.
The other issue I ran into was figuring out how to style the top nav bar to be separate from the bottom nav bar. I eventually learned how to do so with the not() function.
